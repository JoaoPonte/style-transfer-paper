# Style Transfer applied to carbonate reservoir upscaling: a study case from Brazilian carbonate rocks (coquinas)

This is the repo of my paper!  
Here you can find the jupyter notebook with the code, which is not so formatted and beautiful, but it works ;)  
You know, I'm just a PhD student, not a professional programmer (even I willing to be one day soon)  

I will add the link to the paper as soon as it goes public.
